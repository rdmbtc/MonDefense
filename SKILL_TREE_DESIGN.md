## Score-Based Unlock System

### How It Works

- **Early Game** (Waves 1-5): ~50-100 enemies per wave = 500-1000 score per wave
- **Mid Game** (Waves 6-15): ~75-150 enemies per wave = 750-1500 score per wave  
- **Late Game** (Waves 16+): ~100-200+ enemies per wave = 1000-2000+ score per wave

### Progression Timeline
- **Tier 1 Skills**: Unlockable after 5-10 waves of consistent play
